when I push the code to bitbucket,the system reports that:
{% highlight bash %}
fatal: unable to access 'htps://bitbucket.net/bitbucket/xxxxx.git/': SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
{% endhighlight %}
This is because the server's SSL certificate is not certified by a third-pary agency.We can solve it with the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
git config --global http.sslVerify false
{% endhighlight %}
